# Find-Dead-Playlist
Finds missing ("dead") music files on your computer

First off you'll need to create a playlist of tracks which are "dead" in iTunes

1: Create a smart playlist by going to your iTunes menu, click Files and then New Smart Playlist or by shortcut keys Ctrl + Alt + N in your Windows
2: Click on the drop-down box, currently showing Artist,  and choose Playlist
3: In the next box, choose “is”
4: In the next box, choose “Music”
5: Click “+” button
6: On the new row set, click on the drop-down box, currently showing Artist, again and choose Playlist
7: In the next box, select “is not”
8: In the next box, select “Alive Tracks”
9: Press OK, and give it a name “Dead Tracks”
10: Export your new playlist by selecting it and choose File > Library > Export Playlist
11: Save file as .m3u8 filetype

Now you can open FindDeadPlaylist.exe and select your newly created playlist. The program will search your desired drive or directory for missing tracks and put them in chosen destination. 

I hope you find it useful
